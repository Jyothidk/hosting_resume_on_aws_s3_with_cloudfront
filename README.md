## Step 1: Upload Resume to S3 and Configure Static Website Hosting

1. Create an S3 Bucket:
    Go to the S3 console and create a new bucket (jyothi-bucket-for-resume-hosting).
2. Upload your resume (PDF or HTML) to the S3 bucket.
   If using an HTML file, you may need to upload any associated files (like CSS, images).

## Step 2: Set Up CloudFront Distribution
Before setting up cloudfronfron 
. Disable s3 static website hosting
. Block all public access on S3 bucket
. delete bucket policy

    In the origin settings, select your S3 bucket as the origin domain.
